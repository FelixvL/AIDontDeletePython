        Volla Phone are one of our long time sponsors and they are offering a chance to win a Volla 22. In addition they are donating â‚¬10 to Ubports for every phone sold with UT pre-installed.
        A first meeting of an introduction to Ubports group took place recently by video link. The purpose was to explain to newcomers how they might get into being a UT developer or helping in other practical ways. At one point there were twenty people in live chat. We will be holding more of these sessions so watch out for opportunities to join. They will be posted on the Forum and on the News channel. If you are not a developer you can still get involved with testing, documentation and other activities.
        A build of UT has been merged, for Pinephones and PineTab 2.
        A memory fault in VideoRecorder has been fixed. This will put an end to some crashes while watching video. Rachanan had to dig deep into libhybris to figure out what was going wrong. Alfred fixed a bug related to video decoding in the browser so that has also contributed to stability. The next OTA should contain a lot of browser improvements, including hardware optimisation. 4K videos will now work nicely on more powerful devices.'''

	* Work on VoLTE, get plugins working
	* systemd units from within apps
		* Ratchanan: maybe implement background task as account-polld plugin?
	* work on fixing screen rotation and geometry being wrong in landscape orientation (mouse pointer clicks don't arrive where you click, but elsewhere)
	* Transition to apparmor v4 for 24.4.x?        
    
    This was supperb output:
    Muhammad
Muhammad has been heavily investing his time and efforts into working on Voice over Long-Term Evolution (VoLTE). His prime focus is on getting the plugins operational to ensure smooth and efficient communication over the LTE network.

Moreover, he is delving into systemd units from within applications. This particular task has opened up a discussion with Ratchanan, who suggested that perhaps the background task could be implemented as an account-polld plugin. This approach could potentially enhance the efficiency and performance of the background tasks running within the applications.

Muhammad is also actively working on rectifying the issues related to screen rotation and geometry in landscape orientation. Currently, there seems to be a problem where mouse pointer clicks do not register at the clicked location but elsewhere. This is a significant issue that impacts the user experience, and Muhammad is committed to resolving it.

Finally, Muhammad is considering transitioning to AppArmor v4 for 24.4.x. AppArmor is a crucial Linux kernel security module that helps to protect the system by enforcing security policies. A transition to version 4 could potentially bring about improved security measures and optimisations.
