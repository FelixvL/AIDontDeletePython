        Volla Phone are one of our long time sponsors and they are offering a chance to win a Volla 22. In addition they are donating â‚¬10 to Ubports for every phone sold with UT pre-installed.

    A first meeting of an introduction to Ubports group took place recently by video link. The purpose was to explain to newcomers how they might get into being a UT developer or helping in other practical ways. At one point there were twenty people in live chat. We will be holding more of these sessions so watch out for opportunities to join. They will be posted on the Forum and on the News channel. If you are not a developer you can still get involved with testing, documentation and other activities.

    A build of UT has been merged, for Pinephones and PineTab 2.

    A memory fault in VideoRecorder has been fixed. This will put an end to some crashes while watching video. Rachanan had to dig deep into libhybris to figure out what was going wrong. Alfred fixed a bug related to video decoding in the browser so that has also contributed to stability. The next OTA should contain a lot of browser improvements, including hardware optimisation. 4K videos will now work nicely on more powerful devices.'''
